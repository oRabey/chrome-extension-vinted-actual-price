# Vinted Actual Price

Rudimentary Chrome Extension executing a simple script on a Vinted product page, calculating an actual amount including protection and shipping fees.

Note that the calculated price is purely indicative.
Also, as it is possible to buy multiple products from the same seller, the inclusion of the shipping fees in the calculated price may be redundant in such circumstances and the given a final price would not be representative of what you would actually pay.

Of course, this project is in no form associated with the Vinted company.

A breakdown of the script can be found in the src/background/background.js file
